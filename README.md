# ⚡ Retrocession-Strategy-Optimizer-Demo

An AI-powered decision support app to simulate, optimize, and explain retrocession strategies for reinsurers. Built with Streamlit.

---

## 📌 Overview

Retrocession — reinsurance for reinsurers — is essential for managing tail risk, but designing optimal structures is complex.

**This app helps you:**

- Upload or simulate a reinsurer portfolio
- Generate thousands of catastrophe loss scenarios
- Train a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to design optimal retro mixes (XoL, ILW, Sidecars)
- Explain the strategy using a large language model (LLM)
- Export a final strategy summary packet for review or presentation

## 🧠 Features

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `📁 Step 1` | Upload or simulate a portfolio of insured values and losses |
| `🔄 Step 2` | Run catastrophe loss simulations using stochastic modeling |
| `🧠 Step 3` | Optimize retrocession strategy using RL with ROI and CVaR trade-offs |
| `💬 Step 4` | Interpret results using LLM-generated rationale and sample treaty wording |
| `✅ Step 5` | Export decision-ready strategy summary with final table and metrics |
